=================================
         BUILD SEQUENCE
=================================

1. Build the servers based on the configuration-guide.xls found on the hopper~stack website
   in the downloads tab.
2. Ensure 1-9 compute nodes are created
3. All VMs/Servers should be built with a minimum of "Infrastructure Server group"
4. Add all additional networks and storage by design.
5. We recommend only the compute nodes should be physical, all other servers can be created
   as virtual machines until performance becomes an issue.

	[see http://www.hopper-stack.co.uk]

Ensure an NTP server exists or designate HAproxy#1 as the NTP server
when modifying the variables file

	[see http://www.hopper-stack.co.uk on how to create an NTP server on CentOS]


 Login to a buildsvr server to hold the scripts
------------------------------------------------
We recommend a separate build-server but otherwise please choose the repository server
for hosting the scripts

# mkdir /run-scripts
# cd /run-scripts
# tar xf /tmp/hopper-enterprise-mitaka-v1.0.tar

Modify variables file
# vim variables

Run the ansible installer
# cd ansible
# ./ansible-installer

When complete login to controller#1 to verify the build
# ./verify-hopper
