~ What is Hopper~Stack ~

The Hopper~Stack provides an automated installation of the core OpenStack components together with optionally selected support services. 

Support Service included are as follows

	Amanda Backup - Backup the entire OpenStack infrastructure servers
	OpenLDAP      - Directory services for infrastructure servers
	DNS           - Domain Name Services for infrastructure servers
	Nagios        - Monitoring using Nagios s/w
	Squid Proxy   - For downloading anti-virus signatures without connecting servers to the internet
	Logstash      - Centralised log management (Includes, Kibana, Logstash, Elasticsearch and Nginx)
	ClamAV        - Anti-Virus scanner for infrastructure servers
	S3Backup      - Backup the SQL database to S3

We do not provide any licenses for software that requires licensing - we only provide
simple installation scripts.
	
We designed Hopper~Stack to keep up-to-date with the fast paced releases of OpenStack, giving engineers a method of understanding and implementing their own OpenStack environments.

With an aggressive OpenStack release period of 6 months, Hopper~Stack provides BOTH a minimal and advanced installation via standard BASH-Shell scripts to help engineers understand how to build simple or complex environments. 

Using Hopper~Stack, Stackers will be able to learn and develop their own skills and roll out their own versions of OpenStack.

Essentially Hopper~Stack tries to tutor engineers in creating their own cloud offerings using OpenStack.

With shell scripts, many Linux engineers will understand the code easily ~ for others, simply running the scripts and following the guides will still allow them to build environments and gain various OpenStack skills over a period of time. 

Additional Opensource software can also be configured using Hopper~Stack and helps the reader to build an environment as an offering using what we consider some of the best Opensource software available.

Hopper-Stack is designed around CentOS but also installs readily on the popularly used RedHat.

We intend releasing the simplified installation which is based purely on the installation guide, within 2 weeks of the official OpenStack release. However, for the more complex build which also delivers a support service around OpenStack, we will attempt to deliver within 4 weeks.

    Although Hopper~Stack is essentially a bunch of BASH-Shell scripts, we have
    added the ability to use other software freely available in the Opensource
    community so we'd like to take opportunity to thank those developers,
    companies and individuals who produce such great software and ccde.
